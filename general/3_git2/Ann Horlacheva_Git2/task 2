Merge vs Rebase

Integrate changes using both

`git merge`
Giving us simple integration after 'git commit' and 'git pull'

`git rebase`
$ git checkout conflictSolve-branch
$ git rebase -i master

Rebase compresses all changes into one "patch". It culd be dangerous due to the compression of features to several commits, it can hide the context.

Merge is simplifyed safty metod to integrate your changes into main branch. I recomend to use it into your work.
