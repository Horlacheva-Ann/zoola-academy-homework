How to style a series of Git commits

1. git log --pretty=oneline - using this simple command we can see all commits headlines only without body text

2. If you did several changes, create bunch of files, fixed some conflicts and then remember that these changes are necessary need to commit
You can use interactive commit

git commit --interactive

It allows you to add to different commits even changes in the same file.

3. git merge --squash will compresses several commits and saves all changes in the current branch. Then you can commit all changes in one. 
It may be halpful if you need to clean up bunch of minor commits in one or couple major. This makes it easier to keep track of change history.

4. git log --author can do search by author, to show only his commits. In the --author option, you can specify a name or email.

5.  git log --after='date' --before='date' specifying the start and end statistics of commits for range search.
Example git log --after='2021-03-02 17:35' --before='2021-03-03 16:45'


All this commands may can make your job easier, serch and viewing commits faster.
